# Monoalphabetic-Cipher

## Overview
This program implements the **Monoalphabetic Cipher**, a substitution-based encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is replaced with a corresponding letter from a predefined key mapping. It provides both **encryption** and **decryption** functionalities.

## Open in Google Colab

## Features
- Encrypts text using a predefined substitution key.
- Decrypts the encrypted text back to original form.
- Supports both **lowercase** letters.
- Preserves **non-alphabetic characters** (e.g., spaces, punctuation).

## How It Works
1. Each letter in the input text is replaced with its corresponding mapped letter from the **substitution key**.
2. Decryption reverses the process using a **reverse mapping**.
3. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Program
#### **Option 1: Run in Google Colab**
Click the **"Open in Colab"** button above.
#### **Option 2: Run Locally**
1. Download the script `CaesarCipher.py` from this repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python MonoalphabeticCipher.py
3. Enter the required inputs when prompted:
   - A **text message** to encrypt.
4. The program will output:
   - The **encrypted message**.
   - The **decrypted message** for verification.
